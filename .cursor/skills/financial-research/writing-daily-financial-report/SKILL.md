# Writing the Daily Financial Report

## Overview

Assemble the pipeline's outputs into one readable document. This stage is about editing and packaging — no new analysis. If writing reveals a gap, go back to the earlier stage, fix it there, then return.

**Core principle: write for a busy reader who may only read the first ten lines.** The executive summary must stand alone; everything after it is progressively deeper detail.

## When to Use

- Stage 6 (final) of the daily briefing pipeline
- Inputs required: news log, global assessment, China assessment, graded signals, prioritized suggestions

## Report Structure

Use [assets/report-template.md](assets/report-template.md) as the skeleton. Sections in order:

1. **Header** — date, coverage window, one-line market tone
2. **Executive summary** — 3–5 bullets: the day's most important facts + the single most important signal + the top suggestion. A reader who stops here should still be correctly oriented.
3. **Global situation** — from `analyzing-global-macro` output, tightened
4. **China situation** — from `analyzing-china-macro` output, tightened
5. **Signals** — the graded list, strongest first
6. **What to watch (suggestions)** — the prioritized watch-list with triggers/invalidators
7. **Sources & caveats** — key sources consulted; flag any single-source items relied on; standing disclaimer

## Style Rules

- **Numbers, dates, names** — "PBOC cut the 7-day reverse repo rate 10bp to 1.4% on Tuesday", not "China eased policy recently"
- **Source every hard number** — attach outlet/agency on first use of a figure (e.g. BLS, Yicai, Fed). If you cannot name a source, do not publish the figure.
- **Beat/miss is vs consensus, not vs prior** — for inflation, cooler-than-expected = miss; hotter = beat. For growth/jobs, above-consensus = beat.
- **Confidence language is calibrated:** *is/did* for confirmed facts; *appears/suggests* for graded inference; *possible/worth watching* for weak signals. Never present a WEAK signal in *is* language.
- **Facts before interpretation** within each section — reader should be able to see where reporting ends and judgment begins
- **Length:** ~1,000–1,500 words total. Executive summary ≤ 120 words.
- **Quiet days:** say "little regime-relevant news today" in one line rather than inflating minor items. A short honest report beats a padded one.
- **Language:** match the user's request language (Chinese request → Chinese report, keeping key terms/tickers in original form)

## Pre-publish accuracy gate

Before finalizing website YAML, re-check:

1. Every index % change matches the named index's **close** (not another Asia index).
2. Every official print matches the primary release (BLS/NBS/PBOC/Fed).
3. Consensus labels (beat/miss) match actual vs survey.
4. PBOC OMO: ops size, maturity, **net** = ops − maturity, with correct 亿元→CNY bn conversion.
5. No conflicting levels for the same asset in one briefing (e.g. two different gold prices without labels).

## Mandatory Disclaimer

End every report with:

> This report is research and information synthesis, not investment advice. Verify figures against primary sources before acting on them.

## Common Mistakes

- **Calling cooler inflation a "beat"** — below-consensus CPI/PCE is a **miss** / downside surprise, not a beat. Keep consensus vs actual side-by-side so the label is checkable.
- **Executive summary written first and never updated** — write it last, after the body is final.
- **Copy-pasting stage outputs verbatim** — the analysis stages produce working notes; the report needs them edited for a reader (dedupe items that appear in both global and China sections, cut internal jargon like "news-log item #4").
- **Losing traceability while editing** — tightening prose must not detach claims from their sources; keep at least outlet names on key facts.
- **Burying the lede** — if one story dominates the day, it opens the executive summary, even if the template section order puts its detail later.
